### Explanation
The inferred beta vectors (word distributions per topic) and their mapping to the true topics:

1. Inferred Topic 0 maps to True Topic A (similarity: 0.8431)
   - Inferred distribution: bass (0.3676), tuba (0.1772), pike (0.1612), deep (0.1589)
   - True distribution: bass (0.4), pike (0.4), deep (0.2)
   
   This mapping is accurate, as the inferred topic captures the high probabilities for "bass" and "pike". The presence of "tuba" with a notable probability is a slight deviation from the true topic.

2. Inferred Topic 1 maps to True Topic C (similarity: 0.9775)
   - Inferred distribution: tuba (0.2499), bass (0.2319), deep (0.2185), horn (0.1958)
   - True distribution: bass (0.3), tuba (0.3), deep (0.2), horn (0.2)
   
   This mapping shows the highest similarity, with the inferred topic very closely matching the true topic's word distribution. All four main words are present with similar probabilities.

3. Inferred Topic 2 maps to True Topic B (similarity: 0.8108)
   - Inferred distribution: pike (0.3169), bass (0.2150), horn (0.1607), deep (0.1479), catapult (0.1325)
   - True distribution: pike (0.3), horn (0.3), catapult (0.3), deep (0.1)
   
   This mapping correctly identifies "pike" and "horn" as important words, but underestimates the probability of "catapult". The presence of "bass" with a high probability is a notable deviation from the true topic.

Overall, the LDA model has done a good job of recovering the underlying topic structure:

1. It correctly identified three distinct topics.
2. The inferred topics largely correspond to the true topics, with Topic C being recovered most accurately.
3. There are some minor deviations, such as the underestimation of "catapult" in Topic B and the presence of "tuba" in Topic A.

These small discrepancies could be due to various factors, including:
- The stochastic nature of the LDA algorithm
- The finite size of the generated corpus (tested with 100-1000 documents)
- Potential overlap between topics in the original model
