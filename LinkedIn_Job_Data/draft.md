Final Project Report
Advancing Salary Transparency Through NLP: A Comparative Study of Two Approaches for Predicting Salaries from Job Descriptions

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation

### 1.2 Project Objectives and Scope

### 1.3 Overview of Approach

## 2. Data and Methodology

In this project, we explore two distinct approaches for predicting salaries from job descriptions. We utilize the LinkedIn Job Posting dataset, which contains detailed job descriptions, associated salary ranges (min, max), and additional metadata like location and industry.

To verify the effectiveness of our models, we first train and test them on synthetic data with clear patterns and relationships. This allows us to validate our models' ability to capture salary-relevant information from unstructured text.
