Sentence 1:

The tagger correctly predicted most tags, with only one error in the second word, where "coming" was tagged as a NOUN instead of a VERB. 

This is likely because "coming" can function as both a verb and a noun, and the model might have seen it more frequently as a noun in the training data.

Sentence 2:

The tagger made two errors:
1. "face-to-face" was tagged as NOUN instead of ADJ.
2. The final "another" was tagged as NOUN instead of DET.

These errors might be due to:
- The compound word "face-to-face" being rare or unseen in the training data.
- "another" functioning as both a determiner and a noun in different contexts.

Sentence 3:
The tagger predicted all tags correctly for this sentence.

While the tagger performed well overall, it made some errors due to the following reasons:

1. Limited training data: We only used the first 10k sentences from the Brown corpus, which contains 219,770 words and 21,249 unique words. This might not cover all possible word-tag combinations (e.g. face-to-face as an adjective).

2. Simple model: The HMM model with add-1 smoothing is relatively simple (only considers bigrams) and doesn't capture complex language patterns or context beyond bigrams.

3. Ambiguity: Many words can have multiple POS tags depending on context. The model chooses based on probabilities from limited context.
